# Mat-Lab_Code_Truss
Script to Analyse a Simply Supported Plane Truss Element by stiffness matrix method.

Given data:
  EA = 6000KN
  A,B, & C is a plane truss, which looks like a equilateral triangle in 2D and it has 3 member AB, BC & CA. A has pinned support and B has roller support.
  The length of AB is 3m, 1.5m from A to center of the member and 1.5m from the center of the member to B. Height from B to C joint is 2m.
  There are two loads acting on the joint C. Horizontal load acting is 30KN from -x to +x direction. Vertical load acting at C is 40KN from +Y to -Y direction.
  
To Find:
  Joint Displacements.
  Support reactions.
  Bar forces and Bar Elongations.
 
Assumptions
  All bars have same Axial Regidity.
  Take the member AC as 1st, BC as 2nd and AB as 3rd.
